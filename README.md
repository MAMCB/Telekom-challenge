# Deutsche Telekom Student Platform

This is a concept prototype of a solution for the Deutsche Telekom challenge promoted by [Ekipa](https://app.ekipa.de/challenges/telekom-it/brief).
It demonstrates a basic UI layout of how the application flow would work.
It is only a frontend solution with no functioning backend, built with React with Vite and Typescript and Tailwind.css.
It serves only static data set in the data.json file.
To run it locally you can clone the repo, cd to its local directory and then run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
you can then open your localhost server.

## Requirements: 

You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), the recommended version is v20.14.0
