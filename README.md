# Deutsche Telekom Student Platform

This is a concept prototype of a solution for the Deutsche Telekom challenge promoted by [Ekipa](https://app.ekipa.de/challenges/telekom-it/brief).<br>
It demonstrates a basic UI layout of how the application flow would work.<br>
It is only a frontend solution with no functioning backend, built with React with Vite and Typescript and Tailwind.css.<br>
It serves only static data set in the data.json file.<br>
To run it locally you can clone the repo, cd to its local directory and then run:<br>
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
you can then open your localhost server.

## Requirements: 

You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), the recommended version is v20.14.0
